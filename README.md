# Beat Saber Rich Presence
A simple mod that integrates a rich presence to display on your Discord profile a bunch of information about what you are doing.

# How To Use This Mod?
You can easily just drag and drop the .dll and .pdb files into your beat saber plugins folder.

# Dependencies
This plugin depends on [DiscordRPC](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/releases) and [DataPuller](https://github.com/ReadieFur/BSDataPuller/releases) to function. 
For the DataPuller mod, you will need to download the bs version that corresponds to the bs version this mod uses. In this case you would use the DataPuller mod made for bs v1.34.2 since the Presence mod 
v1.0.0 uses bs v1.34.2 aswell.

Below are the correct dependency versions needed for this mod to work:

Presence Mod v1.0.0 ==> DiscordRPC v1.2.1.24

# Any working updates to improve the mod?
